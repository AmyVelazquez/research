                    Guide your organization to make intelligent choices
                </h2>

                <p>UX leaders often talk about the importance of <i>“having a seat at the table.”</i> However, what’s
                    more important is <i>what we bring to the table.</i> </p>
                <p>Right now, your organization faces vital decisions. Decisions that will determine whether the future
                    results in
                    delivering great products or mediocre ones. Decisions that will determine the best way to focus
                    limited resources. If
                    made right, the choices will delight customers and, if made wrong, they will cost the organization
                    money and reputation.</p>
                <p>When high-level decision-makers need to make important decisions, do they have the data and insights
                    to guide them to
                    the best choices? The data and insights are the product of advanced user research. It’s the
                    superpower that UX leaders,
                    just like you, can bring to the table.</p>
                <p>Spend five 90-minute sessions discovering what your UX research efforts genuinely need. Put together
                    a plan that makes
                    your UX team strategic, influential, and innovative.</p>

                <p>
                    This online workshop will be unlike any other workshop you’ve experienced. We call it an intensive because, well, it’s intense. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In five 90-minute sessions, you’ll join Jared Spool on a thorough exploration of how to shape the way your organization makes critical decisions. You’ll complete your journey with a comprehensive UX research strategy that will change your organization forever.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Your research practice will build expertise around users and customers across the organization. You’ll no longer underinvest in research. Stakeholders and executives will use your UX research findings for essential decision-making instead of just guessing.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Each day, from Monday, June 5 through Friday, June 9, you’ll attend a 90-minute session containing a new aspect of Advanced Approaches to UX Research. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    You can choose between the 12pm ET (16.00 GMT) or 7pm ET (23.00 GMT) sessions. Jared will be at both to guide you through the fundamentals and answer your questions.

                        So much of today’s user research efforts are about squeezing what you learn into refining a close-to-done feature or capability. That’s not the point of research. To get the most out of your efforts, you need to uncover the holistic experiences of your users and customers.

                        Continuous research shifts everyone away from the project-by-project piecemeal nature of conventional approaches. Your new strategy will drive continuous learning, making everyone more knowledgeable as your team grows its comprehension of the problems and challenges your users and customers regularly face.

                <p>We guarantee that every session will spur great discussions. You’ll be itching to make immediate

                <p>Everything you learn in this 5-day Intensive comes directly from Jared’s years of working across
                    industries, discovering the best practices for organizations to deliver well-designed products
                    and services.</p>
                <p>His experience, working with design leaders of organizations like IBM, NASA, GE, Fidelity
                    Investments, GM, Exxon Mobil, and the Obama White House, has taught him exactly what teams need
                    to mount strategic, influential UX research initiatives.</p>
                <p>You’ll love his stories, his ability to demonstrate every point with a simple, concrete example,
                    and his comically adorable attempts at trying to draw out his ideas. (You can’t fault him for
                    trying, though.)</p>
                <p>Most importantly, you’ll love how much smarter you’ll feel after spending a few minutes absorbing
                    his experience-informed wisdom. Don’t pass up this opportunity to glean everything you can from
