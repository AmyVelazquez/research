                <br>
                <h2>How Strategic UX Research is different from what’s practiced today.</h2><br>
                <p>Most teams today practice <i>Tactical UX Research.</i> Their work rarely affects more than a specific
                    feature or product.</p>
                <p>Their research results only describe immediate recommendations or changes that will improve the
                    product slightly.</p>

                <p>Tactical UX Research rarely improves our understanding of users or what they need in the long term.
                    This understanding
                    never reaches the organization’s upper levels. The most critical decisions, like budgets, staffing,
                    and priorities,
                    don’t consider the users’ experiences. Yet these decisions affect whether the team will have what it
                    needs to deliver a
                    great user experience.</p>

                <p>Conversely, <i>Strategic UX Research</i> is about attaining a deeper understanding of all the
                    different
                    users and their
                    individual experiences. Everyone, including the executive team, learns more about what makes an
                    excellent experience for
                    users, employees, and customers and how to improve their current experiences.</p>

                <p>These experiences go beyond using the organization’s products or services. They include what happens
                    before, during, and
                    after someone has interacted with the product. Strategic UX Research uncovers the entirety of
                    people's experiences.</p>

                <p>Research teams orchestrate <i>deep-hanging-out</i> sessions with customers and users. They collect
                    observations and insights that show what a day in the life of users could be like. They combine
                    different experiences with the
                    product or service across the user’s lifetime and connect this all together to show a detailed
                    journey.</p>

                <p>In this intensive, you’ll discover the basic principles of <i>Strategic UX Research:</i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Build deep expertise about users and their needs.</li>
                    <li>Focus the organization on improving the daily lives of customers, users, and employees.</li>
                    <li>Combine UX and CX practices to collect knowledge from every touch point.</li>
                    <li>Study holistic experiences instead of small slices of a product’s features.</li>
                    <li>Feed the research results into every outcome and decision.</li>
                </ul>
