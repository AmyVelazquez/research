                        UX Metrics are the cornerstone of a strong UX strategy
                      </h2>
            
                      <h3> Few UX leaders realize how important having the right UX metrics is</h3>
            
                      <p>
                        Too many teams treat metrics as an afterthought. UX leaders try to use metrics to show the effectiveness of
                        their teams’ efforts.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Interestingly, the most successful UX leaders treat their metrics quite differently.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        These leaders use their UX metrics as the ticket out of their organization’s reactive "feature factory"
                        approach. Through metrics, they increase collaboration with their product and development peers. In
                        addition, they promote better experiences as a top-level organizational goal, not just a nice-to-have
                        achievement for the UX team.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In this intensive, you’ll explore what these successful UX leaders have discovered. You’ll uncover the power
                        of having UX metrics so strong that your stakeholders won’t ignore them.
                      </p>
                      <h3>The most successful leaders tell their story using UX metrics</h3>
                      <p>Successful UX leaders use UX metrics to tell a story.</p>
                      <ul class="width80 center">
                        <li>The story of the UX journey the organization is on</li>
                        <li>The story of where they started on this journey</li>
                        <li>The story of where they’re trying to get to</li>
                        <li>The story of the progress they’ve made</li>
                        <li>The story of the obstacles ahead</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Effective UX metrics are how these UX leaders promote great UX throughout the organization. The metrics are
                        how the leaders influence important design decisions, like which functionality should be built next. The UX
                        metrics explain what success for new releases should look like.
                      </p>
                      <p>Their stories must connect the metrics to the organization’s most essential objectives.</p>
                      <p>
                        There’s no magic here. <br> Just simple-to-understand metrics.</p>
